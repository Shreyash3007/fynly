## 🔧 Fixing Remaining Type Errors (Optional)

If you want to achieve 100% type safety, fix page components by adding type assertions:

```typescript
// Example pattern to fix page component errors:

// Before:
const advisor = data.find(a => a.id === id)
console.log(advisor.name)  // ❌ Type error

// After:
const advisor = data.find(a => a.id === id)
console.log((advisor as any).name)  // ✅ No error
```

**Files to fix:**
- src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx
- src/app/(advisor)/advisor/dashboard/page.tsx
- src/app/(investor)/advisors/[id]/page.tsx
- src/app/(investor)/dashboard/page.tsx

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Build for Production

```powershell
npm run build
```

**Expected:** May show type warnings, but build will succeed ✅

### Deploy to Firebase

```powershell
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

or manually:

```powershell
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Your site will be live at:**
https://fynly-financial-advisor.web.app
