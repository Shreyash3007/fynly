## üéØ **IDENTIFIED ISSUES**

### **Issue 1: Profile Card/Page Accessibility** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ Profile pages exist (`/profile` for investors, `/advisor/profile` for advisors)
- ‚ùì **Question:** Is the profile page not visible enough, or is there a specific "Profile Card" component/widget you want in the dashboard?
- ‚ùì **Question:** Should there be a floating profile card/sidebar, or just improve navigation to the existing profile page?

### **Issue 2: Advisor Dashboard - Missing Pages (404s)** ‚ùå
The following routes are missing and causing 404 errors:

1. **`/advisor/availability`** - Set Availability page
   - Purpose: Allow advisors to set their weekly availability schedule
   - Status: Database tables may exist (migration found)

2. **`/advisor/earnings`** - View Earnings page
   - Purpose: Display advisor's earnings, revenue, payouts
   - Status: Need to calculate from bookings/payments

3. **`/advisor/clients`** - Manage Clients page
   - Purpose: View list of clients/investors who have booked
   - Status: Can fetch from bookings table

4. **`/advisor/sessions`** - All Sessions page
   - Purpose: View all bookings (past, upcoming, completed)
   - Status: Can extend existing booking queries

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY**

2. ‚úÖ Profile page accessibility improvement
3. ‚úÖ Availability page (core feature)
4. ‚úÖ Sessions page (essential for advisors)

### **Medium Priority:**
1. Earnings page (important but can show basic data first)
2. Clients page (useful but can derive from sessions)

### **Low Priority (Enhancements):**
1. Advanced calendar features
2. Charts/graphs for earnings
3. Client details page

5. **Sessions:**

6. **Payment Status:**

## ‚úÖ **NEXT STEPS**

Once you answer the questions above, I will:

2. Implement API routes for availability management
3. Enhance profile accessibility
4. Add all necessary database queries
5. Ensure all features work without errors
6. Test complete flow (advisor can manage everything)

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours of development
